            <h2>Managing Scripts</h2>
            <p>When you are developing scripts with multiple files, you need to have ready access to the code, whether or not the scripts are stored in the project or external to the project. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>When scripts are stored in the project, you can easily access and organize your scripts using the project panel.&nbsp; When they are stored external to the project, you can also organize them and manage them from the project panel by creating a connection to the external filesystem folder where you scripts are located.</p>
            <p>When you connect to an external filesystem folder, the scripts are still located in the external folder, allowing other users to access them from the filesystem and allowing them to be managed with source control.&nbsp; However, the files appear inside the project as if they were part of the project, allowing them to be easily opened and edited.</p>
            <p>To create a connection to a folder on the filesystem:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Go to the File menu and select Create Connection, which will open a panel for creating a connection to a filesystem or to a database.</li>
               <li>In the "Create Connection" panel, click on the folder, then enter the path of the folder to which you want to connect.</li>
               <li>When you are finished, click the "Connect" button, which add the folder you selected to the project.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>To open scripts in the connected folder and save changes to it:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Double-click on the script icon in the connected folder.</li>
               <li>Even though the script appear in the project, it's still stored externally.</li>
               <li>To save changes to the script, use "Save As" in the File menu, just as you would with any other script that appears on the project.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>To save new scripts to the connected folder:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Create the new script.</li>
               <li>Go to the File menu and select "Save As".</li>
               <li>In the project "Save As" dialog, select the connected folder next to "Save in:", enter the filename, then press "Save"</li>
               <li>The newly created script will be saved to the external folder and will appear in the project under the folder.</li>
               <li>Of course, you can also save the newly created script using "Save As External".</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you are working with an external connection, you'll sometimes need to refresh the project panel so that it shows newly added files.&nbsp; The reason for this is that files are sometimes added to the external folder without the application's knowledge; for example, this might happen if you are working with other developers on a shared source code repository and other developers add files to the project.</p>
