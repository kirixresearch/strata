            <h2>Creating a Simple Form</h2>
            <p>With scripting, you can do many different things; but often, you'll define an interface that let's you enter information.&nbsp; To create a basic form interface, create a new script, then enter the following in the script:</p>
            <pre>var f = new Form;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // create a new form<br>f.show();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // show the form<br>Application.run();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // process events</pre>
            <p>Essentially, this script says:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Create a new form.</li>
               <li>Show the form.</li>
               <li>Run the application, processing any events the user may perform on the form.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once you've saved the script, go ahead and run it.&nbsp; As you can see, it opens a new form.</p>
            <p>While simple, this script demonstrates the three basic steps to create a new interface with a form:&nbsp; create the form, show it, and process events on it.</p>
            <p>We can easily extend this example to show a custom form.&nbsp; To customize the form, create a custom form, then show the custom form in the same way:</p>
            <pre>var f = new MyForm;     // create a new custom form<br>f.show();               // show the custom form<br>Application.run();      // process the events<br><br>// define the custom form as follows<br>class MyForm extends Form<br>{<br>    function MyForm()<br>    {<br>        // when the form is first created, add a new button<br>        this.add(new Button("Ok"));<br>    }<br>}</pre>
            <p>This script says:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Create a new custom form of type MyForm.</li>
               <li>Show the custom form.</li>
               <li>Run the application, processing any events the user may perform on the form.</li>
               <li>Define MyForm as follows:&nbsp; use the Form type as a starting point, but when it's created, add a button to it with the text "Ok".</li>
            </ol>
            <p>While this script is nearly as simple as the first script, it introduces one important concept, which we'll discuss more below:&nbsp; you can define your own data types from scratch, or from pre-existing data types.&nbsp; When you define a new data type in this way, you are creating a "class", and when you are creating this class from another data type, you are "extending" the other class.</p>
            <p>In the above example, the class MyForm is a new data type that derives its characteristics from another class called Form.&nbsp; When MyForm is created, the MyForm() function inside the MyForm class runs, creating a button that is added to the form. </p>
