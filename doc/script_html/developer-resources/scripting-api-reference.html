            <h2>Scripting API Reference</h2>
            <p>Following is a comprehensive list of the application's API class hierarchy, organized by both category and name.</p>
            <p><a href="../classes_by_category.html" target="_top" class="external-link-new-window">Classes By Category</a><br><a href="../classes_by_name.html" class="external-link-new-window">Classes By Name</a></p>
            <p>In the information about each class, you'll find lists of the properties, events, and functions the class supports, as well as examples of how to use the class.&nbsp; In the individual class definitions, functions are defined with both input parameters and types as well as the output type they return:</p>
            <pre>ï»¿[static] function &lt;class.function&gt;(&lt;input&gt; : &lt;input type&gt;) : &lt;return type&gt;</pre>
            <p>So, for example, in the Core class category, the String class has a function called charCode that returns a character of a string at a specified index.&nbsp; The function is defined as follows:</p>
            <pre>function String.charAt(index : Integer) : String</pre>
            <p>This definition says that the "String" class has a non-static function called "charAt" that takes an input "index" that's an Integer and that it returns a String.&nbsp; In use, of course, you don't actually include the input type; these are included in the definition to help clarify what the function expects and what you can expect it to return.&nbsp; So, when using the charAt function, you might say:</p>
            <pre>var a = new String("abc");<br>alert(a.charAt(1));</pre>
         </div>
      </div>
